# Downloads Folder File Organizer

A simple Python automation script that organizes files in your Downloads folder by moving them into appropriate folders like Documents, Pictures, Archives, and Videos based on their extensions.

---

## How It Works

- Uses os and shutil modules from Python standard library.
- Categorizes files based on extension types.
- Moves files to:
    - .pdf, .txt, etc → Documents
    - .jpg, .png, etc → Pictures
    - .zip, .tar.gz, etc → Archives
    - .mp4, .mkv, etc → Videos
- Automatically skips folders and unsupported extensions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Works on Linux (tested on Lubuntu)
- No external libraries needed

## How to Use

1. Make sure your Downloads folder contains mixed files.
2. Run the script:

## Safety

- Skips directories.

- Uses decorators for logging (just for learning).
